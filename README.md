=======
1. It will parse thr JSON data got from the website using the JSON libraries attached.
2. After parsing it takes the required data using JSON objects and store them in an arraylist.
3. I wanted to display product name, Price and url for the product. So, i saved that data into separate array lists,
   one each for name,price and url.
4. One assumption i made was that all the products are of near same value.
5. I discarded the other products which doesn't satisfy this assumption.
6. Now i need different combinations of the items i have in the array list to display.
7. I used a random number generator within the size of the product arraylist that spits out random sets of combinations
   everytime.
8. The number of sets of combinations is restricted to the two- third size of the entire arraylist.
